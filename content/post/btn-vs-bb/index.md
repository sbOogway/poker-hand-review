# Button open vs Big Blind Call
The ranges of the players are from personal experience and not GTO. I tried to reflect what i encountered so far in
my journey through the micro stakes will be the following:


## BTN range
[![BTN range](BTN_range.png)]
22+,A2+,K6s+,K9o+,Q6s+,QTo+,J7s+,J9o+,T7s+,T9o,96s+,98o,86s+,87o,75s+,76o,64s+,54s

## BB range
[![BB range](BB_range.png)]
88+:0.25,77:0.7,66-22,ATs+:0.25,A9s-A5s:0.7,A4s-A2s,AQo+:0.25,AJo-ATo:0.7,A9o-A8o,A5o,KTs+:0.25,K9s-K2s,KQo:0.25,KJo-KTo:0.7,K9o,QJs:0.25,QTs-Q4s,QTo+:0.7,Q9o,JTs:0.25,J9s-J5s,JTo:0.7,J9o,T9s:0.7,T8s-T6s,T9o,98s:0.7,97s-95s,87s:0.7,86s-85s,74s+,64s+,53s+,42s+,32s

Note that the top of range of big blind is discounted, because we expect a 3-bet at a high frequency.
